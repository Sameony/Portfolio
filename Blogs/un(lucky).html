    <h1 class="header">Luck is a skill?</h1>
    <div class="content">Does being lucky count as a skill?
        Wait, before that, does luck even exist in the
        first place? Or going further back,
        What even is luck?
    </div>
    <h2 class="midHead">Luck</h2>
    <div class="content">
        Luck can have a lot of meanings but they all mainly point towards
         good things, happenings, positivity and success. Wishing luck 
         is basically wishing for success.
        On the other hand, we have the term, unlucky, which, as it sounds, is the
        polar opposite of lucky.
        We have seen all kinds of people, some very lucky, winning everywhere,
        midas touch and stuff...and also the unlucky people, struggling through
        misfortunes everyday as if it is normal.
        What if i told you, there exists a glitch in the matrix where luck and unluck
        stick together?

    <h2 class="midHead">Meet The world's most Unlucky lucky man.</h2>
    <div class="content">Here <strike>lies</strike> lives Mr.Frane Selak from croatia
        who is often dubbed as, sometimes, World's unluckiest man, sometimes as 
        world's luckiest man, and sometimes both.
        Why? What in the world happened here? To understand that, lets take a look at
        the lifetime achievements of him.
    </div>
    <h3 class="smolHead">Year 1962</h2>
    <div class="content">Frane was travelling in a train on a chilly day in January, 
        when the train suddenly crashed and fell into an icy river, killing
        17 passengers. Our Hero survived with only a broken arm and hypothermia.
    </div>
    <h3 class="smolHead"> Year 1963</h3>
    <div class="content">Just one year later, Due to an emergency, Frane had booked 
        a flight trip to see his ill mother. Suddenly, both of the engines of the 
        plane stopped working, and the plane crashed. 19 people on board were killed.
        however, soon after the engines stopped, frane was sucked out of the plane from
        a broken door and he crash landed on a haystack. He only suffered minor injuries.
        That's some serious luck right there.
    </div>
    <h3 class="smolHead">Year 1966</h3>
    <div class="content">Frane was riding a bus that skidded and crashed off the road
        into an icy river (again!). 4 passengers drowned, but frane swam to the shore with
        only minor cuts n bruises.
    </div>
    <h3 class="smolHead">Year 1970</h3>
    <div class="content">At this point, it was clear that public transport was
         not his cup of tea. However, it's not just public transport that's 
         unlucky for him. In 1970, His car engine suddenly burst into flames while he was 
         driving and luckily, he managed to jump out moments before the fuel tank 
         exploded, resulting in him surviving through the day yet again!
        </div>
        <h3 class="smolHead">year 1973</h3>
        <div class="content">In Another episode of car driving accidents, we bring
            to you, Mr. Frane Selak! On a normal peaceful day, his car's 
            fuel pump broke and suddenly, the air vents started blowing the engine's
            flame directly on his face! He lost some hairs, but lived through !
        </div>
        <h3 class="smolHead">year 1995</h3>
        <div class="content">He was casually taking a walk when he was suddenly hit by
            a bus! Guess what happened? Yeah, nothing. He survived with a few minor cuts.
        </div>
        <h3 class="smolHead">1996</h3>
        <div class="content">While driving through the mountains, He had to dodge an
            oncoming truck and he ended up swerving into a guard rail. The rail broke 
            and somehow, he jumped out of the car and grabbed on to a tree branch, 
            while the car plummeted down the mountains. Obviously, at this point, 
            it's clear that The god of transport and vehicles hates him.
        </div>
        <h3 class="smolHead">Year 2003</h3>
        <div class="content">Finally, in year 2003, in an unsurprisingly normal
            event, he won a Million dollar lottery! Yes, at this point, it merely looks
            as if the god of transport and vehicles were just reimbursing his insurance
            money.
        </div>
        <div class="content">And that was the Luck- err, Unluck-... oh well,
            that was the life of Frane seluk, The world's most (un)lucky person!
        </div>
