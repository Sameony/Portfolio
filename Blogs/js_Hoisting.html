    <h1 class="headin">What is Hoisting?</h1>
    <div class="content">JavaScript has a hobby of, say, tidying up things.
        JavaScript is just another PTSD student that wants it's surroundings
        clean and neat. Let's attempt to understand
        it better.<br /> <br>
        <code>
            x=6; <br>
            console.log(x); <br>
            var x; <br>
        </code>
        <br>
        In this piece of code, you'll notice that x is initialized before it
        is defined. What? Is this legal?
        Absolutely. It'll show 6 in the console, the value of x that is. Why?
        Because JavaScript, while going through the code, realizes that "Hey,
        this person initialized a variable. To make it simpler, i'll just <b>move this
        declaration to the top of the block</b>". This behaviour of JavaScript is 
        termed as Hoisting.
