            <div class="content smallify"> Pepsi what? Military? Is pepsi a country? Did i miss
                my history classes? What even happened before?
                <br />
                is this a joke? Well, it is not a joke, apparently. Pepsi was never a joke,
                especially to the russians. Russians love their pepsi. Period.

        <h2 class="midHead">What, when, how and why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
            It's not that far off from today. In 1959, The Americans hosted an "American
            National Exhibition" in Moscow to Showcase their culture and stuff to the
            russians, and even sent the-Then vice president of america, Richard Nixon to
            attend the opening, all because The leader, the-then president of america wanted
            to introduce the american life to the Citizens of the Soviet Union.
            One thing led to another, and amidst a heated debate over capitalism vs communism,
            The Soviet leader was offered an american beverage- The Pepsi.
            The Soviets Fell in love with pepsi and wanted to bring it to their motherland, and as such
            an agreement between capitalism and communism was made, all for pepsi.
            <br><br>

            Soviet currency was not actually usable globally and hence, instead of money, the soviets used a different
            barter.
            vodka. They exchanged vodka, for pepsi. yes.
            Soviets love their vodka. But they love pepsi too.
            <br>
            Fast forward to a few years when the soviets invaded afghanistan to which America started boycotting their
            vodka,
            resulting in a drop of its value and ultimately making the pepsi-vodka contract break off.
            <b>Soviets love their pepsi.</b>
            What do we do? Might as well send a few battleships in exchange for pepsi haha...unless?
            Just like that, Pepsi recieved a Soviet cruiser, a frigate, a destroyer, 17 submarines, and
            a handful of oil tankers â€” instantly making the drink distributor the owner of the sixth-largest navy on the
            planet- All for pepsi.
            Russians love their-

        <h2 class="midHead">The Taunt that burned more than the bombs.</h2>
        <div class="content">The controversy revolving around this incident was not at all light
            and the Pepsi's CEO Donald Kendall Responded to the United States Government (which, obviously didn't like
            the fact
            that pepsi suddenly got so much firepower overnight) by saying<br>
            <span class="quote">
                "I am Dismantling the Soviet Union Faster Than You are."
            </span>
        </div>
        <h2 class="midHead">So...Where is that military force now?</h2>
        <div class="content">Apparently, the condition of the naval fleets and the submarines
            wasn't all that top notch and soon after the incident, PepsiCo sent all the 20 ships and submarines to be
            scrapped
            to recover their cost of all the pepsi that was sold to the soviets. Gone, reduced to money.</div>
